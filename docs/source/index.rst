pyrolite
==========

  pyrolite is a set of tools for making the most of your geochemical data.

The python package includes functions to work with compositional data, to transform
geochemical variables (e.g. elements to oxides), functions for common plotting
tasks (e.g. spiderplots, ternary diagrams, bivariate and ternary density diagrams),
and numerous auxiliary utilities.

Why *pyrolite*?
..................

The name *pyrolite* is an opportunistic repurposing of a term used to describe an early
model mantle composition proposed by Ringwood [Ringwood1962]_, comprised principally
of **pyr**-oxene & **ol**-ivine. While the model certainly hasn't stood the test of time,
the approach optimises the aphorism "All models are wrong, but some are useful"
[Box1976]_. It is with this mindset that pyrolite is built, to better enable you to
make use of your geochemical data to build and test geological models.
